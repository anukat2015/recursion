		<h3 id="tutorial_user">Tutorial - user</h3>
		<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
		<p>The goal of this tool is to provide a platform to help practicing the recursion in SQL.
		All calculations are done directly in the browser, therefore the tool does not require a connection to a database.
		It supports most of the commonly used functions and commands of SQL, including the recursion. 
		For a list of all supported functions and an explanation on how to use them, please refer to the <a href="#sql_reference">SQL reference</a> below.</p>
		
		<h4 id="recursion">Recursion in SQL and in the tool</h4>
		<p>SQL:1999 introduced Common Table Expressions (CTE). A CTE is a temporary set which contains the result of a query. You can refer to this set with a query or it can refer to itself respectively. By referring to itself it is possible to make recursive queries.
		For a more detailed look at recursive queries in SQL, please refer to the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186243%28v=sql.105%29.aspx">official documentation</a> by Microsoft.</p>
		<p>In this tool, a recursive query can be executed step by step. While doing so, the current step, the corresponding code as well as the involved tables will be highlighted. This should help provide the user with a better understanding on how such a query works. It should also highlight the fact, that a recursion should not be considered as an incomprehensible construct but rather as a combination of its separate components, which are, usually, simple queries.</p>
		<p>A query needs to meet a certain criteria to be recognized as a recursive query by the tool. If any of the following points is not fulfilled, the tool will not recognize the query as recursive and thus the step-by-step solution will not be available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>With-Clause</strong><br>A CTE is necessary because it is the only way to make recursive queries in SQL.</li>
			<li><strong>Union All</strong><br>In SQL, a recursion will only return the desired result, if initialization and step case are combined by using the Union All operator.</li>
			<li><strong>Recursive Reference and Join in step case</strong><br>The seconds Select-Statement in the CTE has to refer to itself in some way (the actual recursion). Additionally, this statement also has to contain a Join to guarantee that the result can actually grow with every step</li>
			<li><strong>Selecting With-Clause</strong><br>The outer query has to select at least one column of the just calculated recursion. In reality, this point would not be necessary - it is rather to make the user aware, that the final result of the recursion can only be displayed with this query.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="tutorial_maintainer">Tutorial - maintainer</h3>
		<p>Anybody can create and share data sets that can be used within the tool. 
		This can be done via <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gists</a>, a free platform to share code snippets.
		Once created, such a data set can be imported into the tool by using its unique ID.
		It can be found at the end of the URL or at the top of the page as <i>gist:xxxxxxxxxxxxxx</i>.</p>
		
		<h4 id="creating_dataset">Creating a data set</h4>
		<p>A data set is specified as a simple text file that is created as a Github Gist (the name of the gist does not matter).
		The <a href="http://dbis-uibk.github.io/relax/">RelaX - relational algebra calculator</a> uses the same syntax for its data, therefore gists can be used in both tools.</p>
		<p>The already included flight-database will be used as an example on how to create a compatible gist file for this tool. The full file can also be found 
		<a href="https://gist.github.com/lohlicher/ebe029ac0f9a52454d5e7cc25e01b017">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>First, a <strong>group</strong> attribute has to be defined. It serves as the title of the database and is displayed in the 'Select Database' menu.</p>
		<p>This attribute can consist of any character and is read until the first line break.</p>
		<div class="codeExample">
			<code class="codeExample">group: Flights simple</code>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>The next attribute is the <strong>description</strong>. It is <strong>optional</strong> and does not have to be included.</p>
		<p>It is displayed below the editor and should be used to further describe your data set and to provide additional links to sources.</p>
		<p>It can either be a single-line description, with syntax just like the in group attribute, or a multi-line description where brackets have to be used to indicate the start and end of the description.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>-Syntax is supported to easily convert the description to HTML code</p> 
		<div class="codeExample">
			<code class="codeExample">
			description[[<br>
			Example 1 is a simple recursion to calculate all airports that can be reached from Vienna.<br>  
			Example 2 is basically the same query that additionally counts the steps and calculates the path taken.<br>
			]]<br>
			</code>
		</div>		
		<br>
		<p>Next, one or more <strong>examples</strong> can be defined. This attribute is <strong>optional</strong> as well and can be omitted</p>
		<p>If a data set includes examples, they can be inserted into the editor by using the respective button on the bottom right of the editor</p>
		<p>The syntax with the brackets for multi-line descriptions is used again. To separate multiple examples, a semi-colon is used</p>
		<p>The examples are inserted into the editor with the same format as used in the gist-file, including line breaks and tabulators</p>
		<div class="codeExample">
			<code class="codeExample">	
			example[[<br>
			/* This query calculates all airports that can be reached from Vienna. */<br>
			WITH RecRel(departure,destination) AS<br>
			(<br>
				SELECT departure, destination FROM flight WHERE departure = "VIE"<br>
				UNION ALL<br>
				SELECT step.departure, step.destination<br>
				FROM RecRel AS rec JOIN flight AS step ON (rec.destination = step.departure)<br> 
			)<br>
			SELECT * FROM RecRel;<br><br>
			/* Calculates all airports reachable from Vienna, counts the steps and calculates the path taken. */<br>
			WITH RecRel(step,path,departure,destination) AS<br>
			(<br>
				SELECT 1, concat(departure," - ",destination),departure, destination FROM flight WHERE departure = "VIE"<br>
				UNION ALL<br>
				SELECT rec.step+1, concat(rec.path," - ",step.destination),step.departure, step.destination<br>
				FROM RecRel AS rec JOIN flight AS step ON (rec.destination = step.departure) <br>
			)<br>
			SELECT * FROM RecRel<br>
			]]<br>
			</code>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Finally, the actual data has to be defined. This is similar to defining variables in several programming languages.</p>
		<p>The name of the variable is in this case the name of the table and on the inside, the columns are defined.</p>
		<p>The first line defines the name and the data type of the column. The data type is optional, so each column is either defined as <i>name</i> or <i>name:data type</i>.</p>
		<p>Note that only 'string' and 'number' are supported data types, everything else is treated as a string.</p>
		<p>In the following rows the entries of the table can be defined, where single quotes should be used for strings</p>
		<div class="codeExample">
			<code class="codeExample">
			flight =<br> 
			{<br>
				departure:string,	destination:string,	id:number<br>
				'VIE',			'FRA',			0<br>
				'FRA',			'LHR',			1<br>
				...<br>	
			}<br>
			<br>
			airport = <br>
			{<br>
				location:string,	country:string,	iata:string,	id:number<br>
				'Vienna',			'Austria',		'VIE',			0<br>
				'Frankfurt',		'Germany',		'FRA',			1<br>
				...<br>
			}
			</code>
		</div>
		
		<h3 id="sql_reference">SQL reference</h3>
		<p>This tool calculates queries by itself, therefore not all functions from SQL can be used within the tool. In the following, every possible function and command will be listed and explained further, if necessary.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Select (Distinct) - From - Where</li>
			<li>And and Or</li>
			<li>Order By</li>
			<li>Like</li>
			<li>Wildcards</li>
			<li>Between</li>
			<li>Not</li>
			<li>Aliases with As</li>
			<li>Joins with Using/On</li>
			<li>Left/Right/Full/Cross/Natural Join</li>
			<li>Group By and Having</li>
			<li>Limit</li>
			<li>Union/Except/Intersect (All)</li>
			<li>Aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM)</li>
			<li>String concatenation with concat() in Select</li>
			<li>Basic calculations and modulo in Select</li>
			<li>Recursive Queries</li>
			<li>Comments</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="further_explanation">Further Explanation</h4>
		<p>In order to avoid any lack of clarity, some functions and characteristics of the tool will be further explained:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Referencing</strong><br>It is not necessary to always specify the table in queries. If the table can clearly be determined, the name of the column is enough. However, if a column does not have a unique name, it can't be assign definitely to a table automatically and it has to be specified as <i>table.column</i>.</li>
			<li><strong>Joins</strong><br>Joins of any form will be executed from left to right. This is important when making queries with multiple joins because a different type of join might return different column names and furthermore lead to a wrong result. For example, a Join with Using only returns one column while a Join with On returns two columns with the respective prefix of its table. It is advised to mix different types of joins when making queries, if possible.</li>
			<li><strong>Group By and Having</strong><br>Having can only be used in combination with Group By and only if it follows directly after the Group By statement.</li>
			<li><strong>String concatenation with concat()</strong><br>Any combination of columns and strings can be concatenated in the Select part of the query. This is done by using the concat() function.<br>
			<code class="codeExample">SELECT concat("This is flight ",id," to ",destination) FROM flight</code>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Basic calculations and modulo</strong><br>Calculations with decimal numbers can directly be declared as a column. Alternatively, a calc() function, similar to concat(), can be used.<br>
			<code class="codeExample">SELECT 2*id FROM flight<br>SELECT calc(2+id%2) FROM flight</code>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Comments</strong><br>Comments can be used just like in SQL.<br>
			<code class="codeExample">-- single-line comment<br>/*<br>multi-line comment<br>*/</code>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="unsupported_sql">Unsupported SQL</h3>
		<p>For completeness, here is a list of functions that are not supported by the tool. Mostly because they are not needed or due to technical reasons</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Subqueries</li>
			<li>In</li>
			<li>Is (Not) Null</li>
			<li>Complex data types (e.g. DATE)</li>
			<li>Data Definition Language (e.g. CREATE TABLE)</li>
			<li>Data Manipulation Language (e.g. INSERT INTO or UPDATE)</li>
